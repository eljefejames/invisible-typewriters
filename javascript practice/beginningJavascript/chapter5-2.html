//In this chapter, you learned about how you can use the pow() method inventively to fix a number to a certain number of decimal places.
// However, there is a flaw in the function you cre- ated. A proper fix() function should return
// 2.1 fixed to three decimal places like this:
//2.100
//However, your fix() function instead returns it like this: 2.1
//Change the fix() function so that the additional zeros are added where necessary.
